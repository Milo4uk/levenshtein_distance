the road not taken woods diverged yellow traveler sigh ages hence
shall I compare thee summer’s day temperate darling buds may shake
once midnight dreary pondered weak weary quaint forgotten lore
Tyger Tyger burning bright forests night immortal hand eye
hope feathery thing perches soul sings tune without words
I wandered lonely cloud floats vales hills host golden daffodils
because could not stop death kindly stopped me carriage held
O Captain my Captain fearful trip done prize we sought
how do I love thee count ways depth breadth height
stopping snowy evening woods lovely dark deep promises keep
watermelon days endless laughter fireflies jars childhood slips away
moon glows ancient silver whispers secrets tides obey
autumn leaves crisp whisper ground farewell summer’s golden sound
wild west wind breath autumn thou unseen destroyer preserver
roses are red violets blue sugar sweet so are you
two roads diverged wood I took one less traveled by
when you are old grey full sleep nodding fire
come live with me be love pleasures prove valleys groves
I carry heart with I carry it in my
fog comes little cat feet silent haunches moves
stopping snowy evening woods lovely dark deep promises keep
watermelon days endless laughter fireflies jars childhood slips away
moon glows ancient silver whispers secrets tides obey
autumn leaves crisp whisper ground farewell summer’s golden sound
wild west wind breath autumn thou unseen destroyer preserver
roses are red violets blue sugar sweet so are you
two roads diverged wood I took one less traveled by
when you are old grey full sleep nodding fire
come live with me be love pleasures prove valleys groves
I carry heart with I carry it in my
fog comes little cat feet silent haunches moves
two roads diverged wood I took one less traveled by
when you are old grey full sleep nodding fire
come live with me be love pleasures prove valleys groves
I carry heart with I carry it in my
fog comes little cat feet silent haunches moves
stopping snowy evening woods lovely dark deep promises keep
watermelon days endless laughter fireflies jars childhood slips away
